The app is developed using Ionic/Angular, Firebase as database, Realtime for recipes and Storage for files.

To change the number of recipes obtained from the API, change the value of 'numOfRecipe' in recipe.service.ts.

There are other items in the `others` folder,
1. App Explanation - The explanation of the app.
2. Ionic assessment video - The video of me explaining what I have developed.
