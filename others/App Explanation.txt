In this project, I have built a recipe app using Ionic/Angular. The project is using Firebase as the database, Realtime to store user manually created recipes and Storage to store images uploaded. Besides of user manually created recipes, there are also recipes from Spoonacular (https://spoonacular.com/food-api). First we enter the application, there is a Recipe List page that displays a number of random recipes obtained from API, and also the recipes created by user. On top of the list is a filter bar that allows user to select dish types to filter the obtained recipes to be displayed.

The sidedrawer on the top left corner allows user to view manually created recipes only. In this mode, user can click add button on top right corner to go to Add Recipe page that allows user to add recipe by filling the form, upload an image file and click the confirm button. Back to Recipe List page, user can click a recipe to go to the detail page that show more details of the recipe. If the recipe is manually added, the user can click the edit button on top right corner to go to Edit page that allows user to update the recipe after modifying the information and clicking confirm. In the Edit page, there is also a Delete button at the bottom of the page that allows user to delete the recipe.
